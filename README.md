# AutomationArchitectLab

Enterprise-grade API Automation Platform built in C# using layered architecture.

## Architecture Layers

Core – Execution engine, logging, retry, context, config  
Contracts – Domain request/response models  
Services – Business API engines  
Tests – Scenario orchestration & validations  

## Key Capabilities

✔ Contract-first automation  
✔ Centralized execution orchestration  
✔ Retry & resiliency  
✔ Parallel-safe context handling  
✔ Domain-driven API services  
✔ Enterprise validation layer  

## Why this exists

Most automation frameworks are script-heavy and architecture-poor.
This platform is designed to behave like **real enterprise QA platforms.**
